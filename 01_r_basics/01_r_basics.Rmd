## Welcome

In this tutorial we will show you some basics in R, prior to diving into the user interface of RStudio in the next tutorial. It is important to understand these basics as they will help you later in data analysis and visualization. In addition, these concepts are not only relevant for working with R.

This tutorials builds on several publicly available tutorials and books. These include:

* [RStudio Primers: the basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1)
* [R Tutorial for Beginners at statmethods](https://www.statmethods.net/r-tutorial/index.html)
* _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do). The book is available on as well [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)

Let's go to the next section and delve into R!

## Operators

Operators (German: Operator) tell the computer what to do. There are two main types of operators: arithmetic operator, to perform calculations, and logical operators. You will be familiar with almost all of these operators from your math courses or work with Excel.

### Arithemthic operators

The table below list the arithmetic operators available in R

Operator Description
-------- -----------
+        Addition
-        Subtraction
*        Multiplication
/        Division
^or**    Exponentiation

This code computes the answer to one plus one. Change it
so it computes two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}
1+1
```

The code below computes the factorial of 4. 

```{r factorial-by-hand, exercise=TRUE}
4*3*2*1
```

You can also combine multiple operators and use parentheses, similar to in Excel or when writing a calculation by hand. Feel free to change any of the code below to experiment with the different operators. 

```{r combining-operators, exercise=TRUE}
(2/4)*2-1
```

### Logical operators

Logical operators are listed in the able below. 

Operator Description
-------- -----------
\>       Greater than
\>\=     Greater than or equal to 
\<       Less than
\<\=     Less than or equal to 
==       Exactly equal to
!=       Not equal to

We will look into more other operators in coming tutorials and the usage of operators in several cases. 

```{r logical-operators, exercise=TRUE}
# Is 2 greater than 1?
2 > 1
# Is 2 smaller than 1?
2 < 1
# Are these two strings equal?
"ab"=="ab"
```

## Data types

A data type or simply 'type' is an attribute of data which tells a computer how you programmer intend to use the data. Most programming languages support basic data types of integer numbers (of varying sizes), floating-point numbers (which approximate real numbers), characters and Booleans (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type). 

R has 6 basic data types. Five of these data types are: 

* **character**: `"a"`, `"swc"`
* **numeric**: `7`, `15.5`
* **integer**: `2L` (the `L` tells R to store this as an integer)
* **logical**: `TRUE`, `FALSE`
* **complex**: `1+4i` (complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)

If you would like to know the data type one of an object, you can use one of the commands (functions) listed in the box below. We will look closer at functions in the coming sections.

```{r check-data-types, exercise=TRUE}
typeof("ab")
length("ab")
class("ab")
str("ab")

typeof(1)
length(1)
class(1)
str(1)
```

You will have noted that I wrote the text ab between double quotes (`"`). In R you denote text, in programming often called a *string*with a quote (`'`) or double quote (`"`). I recommend using `"` It is important to both open and close the string. 

Programming languages have varying degrees of 'type safety'. This means that the computer might check that you are not trying to sum up a text and a number. It is helpful to understand data types, as common errors often boil down to errors regarding data types.

Have a look at the calculation below where an attempt is made to add two strings. You will note that when the code is executed R returns an error. 

```{r sum-of-strings, exercise=TRUE}
# Calculating the sum of two strings

"a" + "b"
```

If would like to learn more about strings in R, I suggest chapter 14 of the book _R for Data Science_, available [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html). We will cover some of the topics 

## Variables & assignment

You might have seen in the previous exercises that I used the string "ab" very often and might have wondered whether it would be possible to this a bit smarter by reusing the string "ab". Indeed, it is possible to _assign_ a _variable_ to (almost) everything. More precisely, a variable provides us with named storage that a program can manipulate. These variables are also objects. In this section, I will stick to the term variable. 

A valid variable name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters. The variable name starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number [(tutorialpoints.com)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_variables.htm).

There are different ways to assign a variable. We will use the following operator: `<-` in this tutorial. This is called leftward assignment. You can also assign with an equals sign (`=`) or using rightward assignment (`->`). 

Have a look at the code below. The number `1` is assigned to the variable `one`. The number `2` is assigned to the variable `two`. We compute the sum of one and two and assign this to the variable `solution`. You can view the solution by simply typing solution or by executing the command *print(solution)*.

```{r variable-assignment, exercise=TRUE}
# Assigning 1 to one
one <- 1
# Assigning 2 to two
two <- 2
# Computing the sum of 1 + 2
solution <- one + two
# Viewing the solution
solution
# Printing the solution
print(solution)

```

You can overwrite a variable with a new name simply by assigning a new value to a variable. 

Let's have a look at th more closely. 

```{r variable-assignment-overwrite, exercise=TRUE}
# Assigning 1 to one
one <- 1
# Assigning 2 to two
one <- 2
# Computing the sum of one plus one
solution <- one + one
# Printing the solution
print(solution)


```

Remember that we just spoke type safe, and the varying degrees of implementation of type safety. Not only can you overwrite a variable, you can also change the data type.

```{r variable-assignment-overwrite-type, exercise=TRUE}
# Assigning 1 to one
one <- 1
# Assigning 2 to two
two <- 2
# Changing the data type
two <- "2"
# Computing the sum of one plus one
new_solution <- one + two
```

Finally, it is possible that variables and fields are empty. For people not coming from programming, this can be something new. At this point in time, I would like to delve into too much detail, but keep in mind that there are can be `NA` values in your data - not available. These `NA` values are not interpreted as `0` in calculations. Rather, summing up `NA` values will lead to a `NA` results.

```{r variable-NA, exercise=TRUE}
# NA

na <- NA
one <- 1

one + na

```

## Functions & arguments

### Functions
By now you will have seen that we use commands from time to time. In programming these commands are often called _functions_ and make something happen. Remember that we just computed the factorial by multiplying `4*3*2*1`. Fortunately, the programmers of R have written a function to make life easier and there is a function called `factorial`. Have a look at the code below, where the function `factorial` is called.

```{r factorial, exercise=TRUE}
# Calculating factorial with a function
factorial(4)
```

There are several important elements to note when using functions:

1. If you type the name of a function itself, R will return the code of the function. For some functions the code might not be helpful at first, but it might help you later on, especially when you write your own functions.
2. To run a function, you need to place parentheses after a function name. If a function requires any input to do it's job, you place this input the parentheses.
3. If you place a question mark before the function name, R will print a help page for the function.

```{r factorial-as-function, echo=TRUE}
# Print the code
factorial
# Calculate something
factorial(4)
# Show the help page when working directly in RStudio
?factorial
```

Now it is your turn to run a function. Compute the square root of 962 with the function `sqrt`  in the code block below,

```{r function-assignment, exercise=TRUE}

```


### Arguments

Some functions, like `sqrt`, require an input between the parentheses. This input is called an *argument*. The function `sqrt` only requires a single argument; other functions do not require an argument. Take for example the function `Sys.date`. This function does not require an argument. 

```{r function-arguments-sysdate, exercise=TRUE}

Sys.Date()

```



Functions can also require more arguments. Arguments are separated by a comma (`,`). By typing `?` prior to the function name, you will see the arguments a function requires in the help page. You can also type `args(function_name)` to view the arguments. 

```{r function-arguments-log, exercise=TRUE}

args(log)

```

The function log takes two argument:`x` and `base`. Not all arguments are always required. In this case, a default value for the argument is used. It is always good to check what the default value is. 

```{r example-named-arguments, echo=TRUE}
# Log - would this be 1 or will this be another value?
log(10)
# Let's explicitly set a base number. 
log(10,10)
# With named arguments
log(x=10,base=10)
```

A common function is the function `paste` to combine multiple strings or other elements.  The code block below shows the function `paste`. The argument `sep` is a named argument and is short for separator. Go ahead and try to change the separator to another character. 

```{r function-arguments, exercise=TRUE}

paste("Open","Data",sep=" ")

```
## Vectors

R stores every value as a vector. A vector is simply a collection of data elements of the same type. You can create a vector with the `c` function. 

```{r example-vectors, echo=TRUE}
# A vector of numbers
c(1,2,3)
# A vector of strings
c("apple","pear","banana")
# Generate a vector with random numbers
rnorm(10)
# Or generate a series
seq(from=1,to=10,by=2)
```

If you want to, you can assign each value a name in a vector. 

```{r example-named-vector, exercise=TRUE}
# A vector of numbers
c(a=1,b=2,c=3)
```

Remember, you can also assign vector to variable. Now you understand why the word *object* is more approriate.

```{r example-vector-assignment, exercise=TRUE}
# A vector of numbers
num_vector <- c(a=1,b=2,c=3)

print(num_vector)
```


Creating your own vector can come in useful. Many R functions are vectorised and expect a vector as input. For instance, you can calculate the sum of a vector or calculate the mean of a vector.

```{r example-vector-calculation, exercise=TRUE}
# A vector of numbers
num_vector <- c(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4,e=5)
# The mean of the vector 
mean(num_vector)
# The sum of a vector
sum(num_vector)
# The standard deviation of a vector
sd(num_vector)
# Or the summary of a vector
summary(num_vector)
```

Remember that we just spoke about `NA` values? Have a look at the functions below. 

```{r example-vector-calculation-na, exercise=TRUE}
# A vector of numbers
num_vector <- c(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4,e=5,f=NA)
# The mean of the vector 
mean(num_vector)
# The mean of the vector with NA excluded with na.rm = TRUE
mean(num_vector,na.rm=TRUE)

```

There also functions that take multiple vectors as an input. These functions evaluate the vectors row-by-row. 

```{r example-function-two-vectors, exercise=TRUE}
# Vector 1
vector <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
# Vector 2
vector2 <- c(5,4,3,2,1)
# The maximum of both vectors
pmax(vector,vector2)

```

You will learn more of these functions as we go along in the tutorial. 

## Dataframes & tibbles

Different structures are available to store data in R. These are vectors, lists, matrices and data frames, and more recently, tibbles. In this section, we will look closer at data frames and tibbles. 


### Dataframes 

A data frame is used for storing tables and contains vectors of equal length. Each vector can have it's own data type. Have a look at the code below, in which three vectors are combined to a single data frame.

```{r first-dataframe, exercise=TRUE}

student_names <- c("Student one", "Student two", "Student three")
student_study <- c("Architecture","Civil engineering","Geomatics")
student_age <- c(24,22,25)

df_students <- data.frame(student_names,student_study,student_age)

```

Several commands are extremely useful when working with data frames. These are:

* To determine the number of rows you can use `nrow(my_dataframe) `
* To determine the number of columns you can use  `ncol(my_dataframe)  `
* To view the first rows you can use the command  `head(my_dataframe) `. By adding  `n ` you can specify the number of rows  `head(my_dataframe, n=10) `
* To view a list of the columns and their data types you can type  `str() `


I loaded a data frame called `df_count_data` into R. Try the commands above in the box below.

```{r basic-dataframe, exercise=TRUE}

head(df_count_data)

```

### Tibbles

A tibble is a special type of table. R displays tibbles in a refined way whenever you have the tibble package loaded: R will print only the first ten rows of a tibble as well as all of the columns that fit into your console window. R also adds useful summary information about the tibble, such as the data types of each column and the size of the data set.

Whenever you do not have the tibble packages loaded, R will display the tibble as if it were a data frame. In fact, tibbles are data frames, an enhanced type of data frame.


```{r as_tibble, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

as_tibble(df_count_data)

```

## Packages

Up to now, we have functions that are available in **base R**. The true power of R lies in the tremendous amount of packages that have been written for R. Packages are nothing more than a range of functions. Each of these packages comes with documentation and a help file. R does not load all these packages when you start working with R as this might require lots of storage space. Also, naming between functions of different packages might overlap and can lead to unwanted results.

### Loading packages

A package is loaded with the function `library`. For instance, the package `dplyr`, which we will use extensively in this course is loaded by typing `library(dplyr)`. Another library that we will look at is the `ggplot2` library.  

The `ggplot` function comes with the `ggplot2` library. Let's see what happens if we call the function ggplot.

```{r library, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot
```

Indeed, an error message appears. Prior to calling the function in your script, you need to load the library. You only need to do this at the beginning of your script. Later, we will see that you only need to do this once in your work environment after starting R. 


```{r library-load, exercise=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot
```

### Installing packages

Packages do not come installed with R. If you install R you need to the packages you want to use as well. Again, there is a function to install packages. This function takes as argument a vector of libraries you would like to install; it downloads and install the package. By executing this command you install the package `ggplot2`: `install.packages(c("ggplot2"))`.

### Common errors with packages

The most common error when working with multiple packages is that function names between packages overlap. I've listed a common example below. By looking closely at the messages you will see that the functions `intersect, setdiff, setequal, union` are masked from the package `base`. The package `plyr` masks a number of functions from the package `dplyr`. You can either change the sequence of the packages or you can call functions explicitly by first naming the library and then the function. If, in this case, you would like to use the function `rename` from `dplyr` you would call the function as follows: `dplyr::rename`. 

```{r library-load-warning, exercise=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(plyr)
```
