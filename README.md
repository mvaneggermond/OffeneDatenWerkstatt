# OffeneDatenwerkstatt

This repository contains the markdown files and R scripts for the course 'Offene Datenwerkstatt' or 'Open Data Workshop'. The course was first taught in the 2021 spring semester at the Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz. 

The following learnr pages have been uploaded to shinyapps.io:

1. R-Basics: https://mvaneggermond.shinyapps.io/01_r_basics/
2. Importing data into R: https://mvaneggermond.shinyapps.io/02_r_data/
3. Using R-Studio: https://mvaneggermond.shinyapps.io/03_using_r_studio/
4. Isolating data: https://mvaneggermond.shinyapps.io/04_isolating_data/
5. Wide and long data
6. Merging data sets: 

The data sets themselves are, in some cases, too large to upload to Github. PM me to get the data sets. I plan to update the code to reference to cloud storage to read the data sets.
