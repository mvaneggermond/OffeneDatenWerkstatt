## Welcome

In this tutorial we will be looking at RStudio's interface. More specifically, we will be looking at RStudio Server. RStudio provides a GUI to working with the software R. It is freely available and comes as stand-alone software or as a server version.

## RStudio Interface

The Rstudio server interface consists of the following windows:

* Top-left: Script window, Data Viewer
* Bottom-left: Console, Terminal
* Top-right: Environment
* Bottom-right: Files, Plots, Packages, Help


```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "RStudio Cloud"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio_cloud.png")

```

### Script window

In the script window, you write your code. You can execute your code by pressing **command+enter** (OS X),  **CTRL+Enter** (Windows) or pressing **Run** in the top bar of the Script window. If you don't have a script window yet, you can open a script by heading to **File -> New File -> R Script**. 

When you type code, you will note that, from time to time, RStudio offers suggestions for auto completing code. For instance, when typing `read_csv`. 

```{r fig2, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "Script window"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/read_csv.png")

```

If you type `View(my_df)` a new tab will open with the contents of a loaded data frame. 


### Console

The results of the code you run will appear in the console on the bottom left.


### Environment

The objects that you have loaded in your environment will appear in the environment window.

### Files, Plots, Packages, Help

The bottom right window provides you with five tabs:

* **Files**: An explorer to view your files. 
* **Plots**: Any plots that you might have generated
* **Packages**: An overview of the packages that are available and installed.
* **Help**: Documentation of R. Accessed by typing `?package_name` or `?function_name`

## Installing R and RStudio

The web page [Installing R and RStudio](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) offers a good introduction to installing R and RStudio on your local machine.
